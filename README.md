# UFOs
Overview of Project: 
The puropose of the module is to build a table using stored data in JavaScrip, create filters to make the newly created table more dynamic to the user, and customize a webpage using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The application of the filters will make user interaction more accessible and facilitate accurate search results. Our client, who is a UFO enthusiest, wants to build a website for the believers and nonbelievers alike so they can search sighting results and decided for themselves if aliens do indeed exist. 

Results: By inserting a table with filters in the index.html code, we are able to search through large amounts of data. The table has filters such as date, city. state, country, and shape. The code is written to pull data from a file of all recorded UFO sightings and to narrow down results based on the search and filter criteria.

As shown by the following screenshot, searching for data is simple and requires minimal input from the user.

Summary: One drawback in the website is within the search criteria. The data seems cumbersome and should have fewer criteria to search. If someone using the sight doesn't know the date of a sighting, for example, narrowing down the search will take some time to produce the results that the user was looking for. Also, the filters are case sensitive, which can make a search more time consuming and frustrating for the user.
